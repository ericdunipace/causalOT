\arguments{
\item{x1}{Either an object of class \linkS4class{causalWeights} or a matrix of the covariates in the first sample}

\item{x2}{\code{NULL} or a matrix of the covariates in the second sample.}

\item{a}{Empirical measure of the first sample. If NULL, assumes each observation gets equal mass. Ignored for objects of class causalWeights.}

\item{b}{Empirical measure of the second sample. If NULL, assumes each observation gets equal mass. Ignored for objects of class causalWeights.}

\item{penalty}{The penalty of the optimal transport distance to use. If missing or NULL, the function will try to guess a suitable value depending if debias is TRUE or FALSE.}

\item{p}{\eqn{L_p} distance metric power}

\item{cost}{Supply your own cost function. Should take arguments \code{x1}, \code{x2}, and \code{p}.}

\item{debias}{TRUE or FALSE. Should the debiased optimal transport distances be used.}

\item{online.cost}{How to calculate the distance matrix. One of "auto", "tensorized", or "online".}

\item{diameter}{The diameter of the metric space, if known. Default is NULL.}

\item{niter}{The maximum number of iterations for the Sinkhorn updates}

\item{tol}{The tolerance for convergence}
}
\value{
For objects of class matrix, numeric value giving the optimal transport distance. For objects of class causalWeights, results are returned as a list for before ('pre') and after adjustment ('post').
